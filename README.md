# Tic-Tac Human AI

## Description

Create a Tic-Tac-Toe AI that learns to play like a human. For example, if Cassandra is playing against our AI. After an x amount of games our AI play style will mimic the style of Cassandra. 

## The Approach

Trick out a Minimax Algorithm! Our AI will create a probability score of when the previous user picks the most optimal move. 
Then using that probability, our AI will either choose that move or a random move. For example, After playing against Zane, our AI noticed Zane chooses the most optimal move 48% of the time. In return, our AI will choose the most optimal move 48% of the time.

## Results
Upon completing the project we were able to compare our Optimal Moves to Total Moves and found several other key datapoints. We also, compared Predicted Percent to Actual Percent.
